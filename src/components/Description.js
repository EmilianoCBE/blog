        <p>This blog will serve as a thought disposer, as a life and tech knowledge
            diary, and also for curiosities and random night thoughts.
            Currently working on improving this site as it is my first blog ever so
            I wil keep learning to make this reading experience the best I can.
            IÂ´ll also leave my social media sites so we can get in touch.
